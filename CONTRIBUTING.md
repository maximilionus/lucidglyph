## How you can help


### Packaging
Back on `0.7.0` release I expressed my dissatisfaction with Linux packaging
support, since it takes too much of my time to achieve so little of result[^1].
Since then I changed my mind about packaging in general. I still have no desire
to maintain any packages myself, but always welcome anyone to help me with that.

Below are the instructions describing ways this project can be correctly
deployed on Linux systems. Before proceeding to them, make sure to read the
README [details section](./README.md#details) to get an overall knowledge about
the technical part of this project.
